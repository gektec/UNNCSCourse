COMP2065-IFR Exercise 08
(permutation)

Our goal is to prove that reverse outputs a permutation of its input.

/-
In the lecture we have introduced the function reverse
(and the auxilliary function snoc)
-/

def snoc : list A → A → list A
| [] a := [a]
| (a :: as) b := a :: (snoc as b)

def rev : list A → list A
| [] := []
| (a :: as) := snoc (rev as) a

/-
Show that rev (or fastrev) does actually outputs a permutation
of its input. 

I include the definition of Perm (and the auxilliary Insert)
here. 

Hint : You will need to state and prove a lemma about snoc.

| ins_tl : ∀ a b:A, ∀ as as': list A, Insert a as as' 
        → Insert a (b :: as) (b :: as')

inductive Perm : list A → list A → Prop 
| perm_nil : Perm [] []
| perm_cons : ∀ a : A, ∀ as bs bs' : list A,Perm as bs 
      → Insert a bs bs' → Perm (a :: as) bs'

Extra Challenge (NOT REQUIRED - NOT WORTH ANY MARKS)
If you are looking for a challenge try to prove that Perm is
an equivalence relation, that is 

The first one is quite easy (I'll do it in the lecture) but the other 
two are very difficult and require some lemmas.
