(fast reverse) 

Our goal is to prove that fast reverse computes the same function
as reverse.

open list
set_option pp.structure_projections false
variables {A B C : Type}
namespace revDefn

/- 
In the lecture we have introduced the function reverse
(and the auxilliary function snoc)
-/

def snoc : list A → A → list A
| [] a := [a]
| (a :: as) b := a :: (snoc as b)

def rev : list A → list A 
| [] := []
| (a :: as) := snoc (rev as) a

/- 
Our implementation of rev is inefficient: it has O(n^2) complexity.
The definition below (called fastrev) is efficient, having only O(n) complexity.
It uses an auxillary function revaux which accumulates the reversed 
list in a 2nd variable.
-/

def revaux : list A → list A → list A
| [] bs := bs
| (a :: as) bs := revaux as (a :: bs)

def fastrev (l : list A) : list A
  := revaux l []

#reduce fastrev [1,2,3]


end revDefn

However we would like to show that fast rev and rev do the same thing.

You'll need to establish a lemma about revaux (hint: try writing
down a precise specification of what revaux does).

You may use the fact that lists with ++ form a monoid 
(just copy the proofs from the lecture).
