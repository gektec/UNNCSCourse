inductive list (A : Type)
| nil  : list
| cons : A → list → list

nil is denoted by []
cons a as is denoted by a :: as
[a] is shorthand for a :: []

Notes:

1. `rev` is defined using the helper function `snoc`. So 
   proofs on `rev` will usually require a helper lemma 
   on `snoc`.

2. Remember that in some cases you can obtain a stronger 
   inductive hypothesis if you apply induction earlier.
