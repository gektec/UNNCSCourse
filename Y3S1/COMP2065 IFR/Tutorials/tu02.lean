# Tutorial 2: Propositional logic ─ Constructive and classical reasoning

+ Provable or not?
+ Classical logic principles: excluded middle (`em`), double-negation
  elimination ("DNE"/"RAA")
+ Practice with constructive and classical proofs

IDEA: Truth table reasoning

example : P → Q :=
begin 
  sorry, -- P=true Q=false

example : P → (P → Q) → Q :=
begin 
  assume p pq,
  apply pq,

example : P → (Q → R) → R :=

  assume f,
  exact f,

    P    |   ¬P    |   P ∨ ¬P

  true   |  false  |   true  
  false  |  true   |   true

example : P ∨ ¬ P :=

  IMPORTANT: Truth table reasoning will only tell you if something
  is provable or not. It WON'T tell you whether it can be proved
  intuitionistically or if classical reasoning is required

## Classical Reasoning

-- Excluded middle: for any proposition P, (P ∨ ¬P).

theorem em_to_raa : (P ∨ ¬ P) →  ¬¬P → P :=
begin
  assume pnp nnp,
  cases pnp with p np,
    assumption,
    ------------------
    have efq : false → P,
      assume f,
      cases f,
    apply efq,
    apply nnp,
    assumption, 
end
-- Notice: This proof doesn't use any classical reasoning itself

-- This one does though
theorem raa : ¬¬P → P :=
begin 
  assume nnp,
  cases em P with p np,
    assumption,
    ------------
    have efq : false → P,
      assume f,

  KEY IDEA: A theorem is intuitionistically/constructively provable
  if we're not "getting information from nowhere"

  ¬ P ∨ ¬ Q → ¬ (P ∧ Q) -- Intuitionistic 
  ¬ (P ∧ Q) → ¬ P ∨ ¬ Q -- Classical

  Intuitionistic logic (the "BHK Interpretation")
  - Proof of P ∧ Q : 
      a proof of P and a proof of Q
  - Proof of P ∨ Q : 
      one bit of info (left or right), and a proof of that side
  - Proof of P → Q : 
      an algorithm that turns proofs of P into proofs of Q
  - Proof of ¬ P : 
      an algorithm that turns proofs of P into proofs of absurdity
