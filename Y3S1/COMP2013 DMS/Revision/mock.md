# DMS Mock Exam

### Q1. Build files [6 marks]

Build scripts are sets of instructions for how the project should be compiled, tested and deployed. Setting up build scripts is helpful for software projects to help improve maintainability.

List two examples of build tools **[2 marks]**, 
and explain benefits of these build tools in software development. **[2 marks]**

### Q2. Debugging Source Code [4 marks]

Which of the following strategies could a developer use to debug source code? Answer all those that apply. 

1.   Follow Coding Conventions
2.   Read the code
3.   Use accessor methods
4.   All of the above

### Q3. Design Patterns [4 marks]

The diagram below shows a reverse engineered UML class diagram for creating different shapes. What design pattern is it using [3 marks]?

When should you use this pattern, and why [5 marks]?

Provide another brief real-world scenario of usage (different to that represented above), and justify why the pattern helps [4 marks].

### Q4. Git usage

### Q5. GUI design

Which THREE of the following are appropriate guidelines for building a successful user interface?

-   [ ] Choose careful wording of messages and controls appropriate to the type of users you have
-   [ ] Use design elements to draw attention to important controls
-   [ ] Use the same interface implementation across multiple devices
-   [ ] It is always best to design your own set of style guidelines (e.g. to specify a CSS stylesheet) from scratch
-   [ ] Make sure you utilise a large range of colours across the interface
-   [ ] Show progress status when performing background work

### Q6. Implementing UML

Look at the code snippet below. Which type of relationship is implemented here?

```java
package exam1;

public class Employee {
    private int numJobs;

	public void useMachine(Machine machine) {
        System.out.println("Using machine: " + machine);
        numJobs++;
    }
    
    public void printInfo() {
        System.out.println("Number of jobs: " + numJobs);
    }
}
```

-   [ ] Dependency
-   [ ] Aggregation
-   [ ] Composition
-   [ ] Association
-   [ ] No relationship present

### Q7. OO Design Concepts

Which of the following statements about polymorphism are true? (More than one answer is possible.)

1.   Polymorphism enforces encapsulation.
2.   Overloading is a type of polymorphism.
3.   Polymorphism can be implemented using inheritance. 
4.   Polymorphism is enforced using design patterns.
5.   Method overriding is a type of polymorphism.

### Q8. Developing Open Source Software

Discuss the differences between permissive and copyleft open source licenses.
