## Process scheduling

**Context**

-   The OS Is responsible for **managing** and **scheduling processes**
    -   decide when to **admit** processes to the system (new -> ready)
    -   decide which process to **run** next (ready -> run)
    -   decide when and which processes to **interrupt** (running -> ready)
-   It relies on the **scheduler** to decide using a **scheduling algorithm**
    -   the type of algorithm is influenced by the **type of OS**

-   Two types
    -   **CPU-bound** or compute-bound
    -   **I/O-Bound**

### Process schedulers

**Classification by Time Horizon**

-   **Long term**: 
    -   applies to **new processes** and controls the degree of multiprogramming by deciding which processes to admit to the system when
    -   A good **mix of CPU and I/O bound processes** is favourable to keep all resources as busy as possible
    -   usually absent in popular modern OS
-   **Medium term**
    -   controls swapping and the degree of multi-programming
-   **Short term**
    -   manages the **ready queue**
    -   invoked very frequently, hence must be fast
    -   usually called in response to **clock interrupts**, **I/O interrupts**, or **blocking system calls**

**Classification by Approach**

-   **Non-preemptive**: processes are only interrupted **voluntarily**
-   **Preemptive**: processes can be interrupted **forcefully or voluntarily**
    -   Typically driven **by interrupts from a system clock**
    -   Requires additional context switches which generate **overhead**
    -   Prevents processes from **monopolising the CPU**
    -   Most popular modern operating systems are preemptive

## Performance Assessment

-   **User oriented criteria:**
    -   **response time**: minimise the time between creating the job and its first execution
    -   **turnaround time**: minimise the time between job creation and completion
    -   **predictability**: minimise the variance in processing times
-   **System oriented criteria**
    -   **Throughput**: maximise **the number of jobs processed** per hour
    -   **Fairness**
        -   Are processing power/waiting time equally distributed?
        -   Are some processes kept waiting excessively long? (**starvation**)

-   Evaluation criteria can be **conflicting**
    -   improving the response time may require more context switches
    -   hence worsen the throughput and increase the turnaround time

## Scheduling Algorithms

-   Algorithms considered 
    -   First Come First Served (FCFS) / FIFO => **non-interactive system**
    -   Shortest job first => **non-interactive system**
    -   Round robin => **interactive system**
    -   Priority queues => **interactive system**
-   Performance measures used
    -   **Average response time**: avg time taken for all the processes to *start*
    -   **Average turnaound time**: avg time taken for all the processes to *finish*

### First Come First Served (FCFS)

-   **Concept**: a **non-preemtive algorithm** that operates as a **strict queueing mechanism** and schedules the processes in the same order that they were added to the queue
-   **Advantages**: 
    -   **positional fairness** and easy to implement using a **FIFO queue**

-   **Disadvantages**
    -   **Favours long processes** over short ones
    -   Could **compromise resource utilisation**
-   An example
    -   Average response time = 0 + 7 + 9 + 15 = 31/4 = 7.75
    -   Average turn-around time = 7 + 9 + 15 + 20 = 51 4 = 12.75

-   **Concept**: a **non-preemtive algorithm** that starts processes in order of **ascending processing time** using a provided/known estimate of the processing
-   **Advantages**: 
    -   always result in the **optimal turn around time**

-   **Disadvantages**:
    -   **starvation** might occur
    -   **fairness** and **predictability** are compromised
    -   **processing times** have to be known beforehand
-   An example
    -   Average response time = 0 + 2 + 7 + 13 = 22/4 = 5.5
    -   Average turn around time = 2 + 7 + 13 + 20 = 42/4 = 10.5

-   **Concept**: **a preemptive version of FCFS** that forces context switches at **periodic intervals or time slices**
    -   Processes run in the order that they were added to the queue 
    -   Processes are forcefully **interrupted by the timer**
-   **Advantages:**

    -   Each process is allocated CPU time to response more efficiently

    -   Improved **response time** 
    
    -   Effective for general purpose **interactive/time sharing systems**
-   **Disadvantages:**

    -   Increased **context switching** and thus **overhead** 
    -   Favours **CPU-bound** processes (which usually run long) over **I/O** processes (which do not run long)
    -   Can **reduce to FCFS**
-   Core of this alg. => **the length of time slice**

    -   assume a multi-programming system with preemptive scheduling and a context switch time of `1ms`
        -   a **good response time** is achieved with a **small** time slice
        -   a **high throughput** is achieved with a **large** time slice
    -   time slice too short => too much context switch => less efficiency in CPU
    -   time slice too long => longer response time
-   An example

    -   Average response time = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 6/4 = 1.5
    -   Average turn-around time = 6 + 17 + 19 + 20 = 62/4 = 15.5

### Priority Queues

-   **Concept**: A **preemptive algorithm** that schedules processes by priority (high â†’ low)
    -   A round robin is used within the same priority levels 
    -   The process priority is saved in the **process control block**
-   **Advantages**: can prioritise I/O-bound jobs
-   **Disadvantages**: low priority processes may suffer from **starvation** (when priorities are static)
-   An example:
    -   Average response time = 0 + 1 + 11 + 13 = 25/4 = 6.25
    -   Average turn around time = 10 + 11 + 13 + 20 = 54/4 = 13.5

## Quiz

1.  **On a Non-Preemptive Operating System, What Can a Process Do Without Volunteering to Cede the CPU?**

-   CPU-Bound Tasks
-   Executing Instructions
-   Processing Data in Memory

2.  **Using the Non-Preemptive Shortest Job First Scheduler, Does the Shortest Job Run on the CPU Until Completed?**

-   Yes. Since it will not be interrupted and it would be run first for it is the shortest job.
