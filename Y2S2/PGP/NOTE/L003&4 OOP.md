## L003&4: Object Oriented Programming

##### 1. Object-Oriented Programming

-   Procedural Programming: 

    -   list of instructions to tell the computer what to do step by step

-   Object-Oriented Programming: 

    -   programs are organized around data

        

##### 2. Classes and objects

-   Classes: **templates** that specify how to build individuals
-   Objects: **instances** of a particular class

-   Class General Form

```java
class classname{
    // declare instance variables
    type varname;
    
    // declare constructors
    classname(parameters){
        // body of constructors
    }
    
    // declare methods
    type methodname(parameters){
        // body of method
    }
}
```



##### 3. Reference variables

-   when creating an instance of class, the space is reserved in **heap memory**

    ```java
    bill = new Elephant();
    andy = new Elephant();
    ```

-   the variables `bill` and `andy` refer to two different objects, like pointers



##### 4. Constructors

-   Constructor is used to initialize an object when it is created

    ```java
    Vehicle(){
        fuleCap = 14;
        mpg = 12;
        passages = 4;
    }
    ```

-   The name of a constructor must be consistent with its class name

    ```java
    Vehicle car = new Vehicle();
    ```

-   Problems: different objects may have different initial values

    ```java
    // Constructor with parameters
    Vehicle (int f, int m, int p){
        fuleCap = f;
        mpg = m;
        passages = p;
    }
    Vehicle car = new Vehicle(14, 12, 4)
    ```

    

##### 5. Keyword `this`

-   Problem: 

    -   the value of a local variable is assigned to an instance variable of the **same name**

-   `this`

    -   an implicit argument that refers to the object on which the method is called

    ```java
    class ThisTest{
        int a, b;
        
    	public void setData(int a, int b){
            this.a = a;
            this.b = b;
        } 
        
        public static void main(String[] args){
            // body
        }
    }
    ```

    ```java
    class ThisTest{
        int a, b;
        public static void main(String[] args){
            ThisTest tt = new ThisTest();
            tt.a = 10;
        }
    }
    ```



##### 6. `static` keyword

-   `static`
    -   to define a class member that will be used independently of any objects of that class
-   static variables
    -   global variables for all objects of a particular class
    -   i.e. all instance of the class share the same static variables

##### 7. Access Modifiers

-   Controls the member access in java
-   4 types of access modifiers
    -   `public, private, default, protected`
-   `public`: can be accessed by any other code in your program
-   `private`: can only be accessed by other members of its own class
-
