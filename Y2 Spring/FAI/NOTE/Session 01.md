#### 1. The Turing Test

>   **It is a satisfactory operational definition of intelligence**



-   **Procedures**
    -   The test is conducted with ==two ppl and a machine==
    -   One person plays the role of an evaluator and is in a ==seperate== room from the machine and the other person
    -   The evaluator cannot see them
    -   The evaluator's task: to find out which one is human by asking them questions
    -   The machine's task: to fool the evaluator into thinking that it is a person
    -   If the machine can fool the evaluator 30% of the time, it is considered **==intelligent==**



-   A real life example:
    -   Eugene Goostman



-   What would a computer need to pass the Turing Test
    -   Natural language processing
    -   Knowledge representation
    -   Automated reasoning
    -   Machine learning
    -   Vision
    -   Motor control
    -   Other senses



#### 2. The Chinese Room

-   The system comprises of:
    -   a human who only understands English
    -   a rule book written in English
    -   two stacks of paper
        -   one stack is blank
        -   the other has symbols on them
-   In computing terms
    -   the human is the CPU
    -   the rule book is the program
    -   the two stacks of paper are storage devices



-   Searle's Claim
    -   The Chinese Room is capable of passing the Turing Test and therefore **intelligent** according to Turing
    -   But the system does not understand Chinese
    -   Therefore, running the right program does not necessarily generate **understanding**.
        The system only act as it understands Chinese
    -   It is an **objection** of the Turing Test



#### 3. Categories of AI

-   Strong AI:
    -   a system can have a mind and mental states
-   Weak AI:
    -   a system can ==act intelligently==
    -   there are non-intelligent ways to achieve intelligent tasks
