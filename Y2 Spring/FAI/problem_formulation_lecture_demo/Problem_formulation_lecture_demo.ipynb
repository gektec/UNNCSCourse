    "Navigating a robot through a grid from a start point to a goal point. This problem involves defining an initial state, possible actions, a goal test, and a path cost function.\n",

    "* **Initial State**: The location of the robot on the grid (e.g., the bottom-left corner, represented as (0, 0)).\n",
    "* **Actions**: The set of moves the robot can make at any point, typically Up, Down, Left, and Right.\n",
    "* **Goal Test**: A function to determine if the robot has reached its goal location (e.g., the top-right corner of the grid).\n",
    "* **Path Cost**: A function that assigns a cost to a path. In the simplest case, this could be the number of moves made from the initial state to the goal.\n",
