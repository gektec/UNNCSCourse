-- Program: maze
-- 
-- A maze is represented as a list of Strings. 
-- Each character has the following meaning:
-- '.' = empty space;
-- '#' = wall;
-- 'A' = starting point;
-- 'B' = finish point.
--
-- Task is to find an unbroken path across empty spaces from A to B, without hitting walls or leaving the maze. Show the path as a trail of asterisks '*'.
--
-- Write programs that will do this by depth-first and breadth-first search from A to B.

-- 4 example mazes.

        "...",
