# We can use the import statement to include other python
# code or modules within our programs. There is a large
# collection of existing functionality in the standard library.
# Here we import the maths module from the standard library
# (https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) 
# which allows use to perform common mathematical operations

import math

# Sometimes, we will only want to import a specific piece
# of functionality from a module. We can specify which we want
# by using the "from" keyword, as below. 
# This line should be read as "from the module os, import the
# function "getcwd" into the current namespace.
from os import getcwd

# We use "#" to write comments. This will be ignored by Python.

# Important
# Notice the importance of indentation in python. There are no
# brackets to define structure as there is in C. This is 
# completely replaced by indentation.

# We declare a function using the "def" keyword, followed by the
# function name (square) and (). Inside the () we may add parameters
# (x). Multiple parameters can be specified by using "," e.g. (x,y,z)
def square(x):
    # Simply return the number (parameter) timed by itself.
    return x * x

# We can define some parameters as being optional, by specifying a
# default value, as we've done here with parameter b.
# This can be overridden by the caller e.g. (sayHi("Jack", "Jill")
def sayHi(a, b="Bob"):
    print("Hello", a, "and hello", b)
    
    # This is how we define our main entry point into the program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    
    # We can declare variables without specify a type. Python
    # is dynamically typed, meaning a type will be deduced, 
    # by the Python runtime
    
    a = 13  # Integer
    b = 1.3 # Decimal Number
    c = "Hello!" # String
    d = True # Boolean
    e = None # NoneType: indicating the absence of a value.
    
    # We can output, to the console, using "print"
    print("hello world")
    # Print can accept many values, of many types.
    print(a, b, c, d, e)
    
    # If conditional,
    if a > 0:
        print("Number is positive")

    # Print the second element of the list:
    print(names[1])
    # Add a new name to the list:
    names.append("Evan")
    # There are built-in methods to help us manage lists
    # Sort the list:
    names.sort()
    # Print the new list:
    print(names)
    
    # Tuple

    # We can loop using "for". Here we say, for each element
    # in our list ([1,2,3,4,5]), represent each single element
    # with the variable named i. We then pass "i" to the function
    # we defined above (square) and print the value returned from 
    # that function
    for i in [1,2,3,4,5]:
