//Written explanation for Q1-Q3

To convert any relation into 1NF, split any non-atomic values
JUST let "appointment date" be one column and "time" be one column to convert it 

Q1
INSERT Anomalies:can not add a "appointment data" without "time".
DELETE Anomalies:IF we remove "S1032" then P110, "John Walker" will be removed as well.
UPDATE Anomalies:IF we change the patient name"Ian MacKay",we will need to update two rows.
